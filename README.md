# Forest Night Theme for Logseq

This is my first [logseq](logseq.com) theme based on [Sacred Forest](https://github.com/karoliskoncevicius/sacredforest-vim) color scheme for VIM.

From the name you will know this mainly focuses on the dark theme.

## Installation

There are two css files: `custom_full.css` and `custom_slim.css`.

- `custom_slim.css` has the basic color scheme.

- `custom_full.css` adds 3 standalone features on top of `custom_slim.css`

    1. add number list by adding inline tag `#numlist`.
    2.  add Kanban feature by adding inline tag `#kanban`, `#kanban-small`, `#kanban-w100`, `#kanban-w200`, `#kanban-w300`, or `#kanban-w400`.
    3.  highlight current path.
  
> Note that these features are all integrated from [here](https://github.com/cannibalox/logseq-dark-hpx).


- You can rename either of them to `custom.css` and copy into the `logseq` folder under you logseq notes.

- Alternatively you could just copy-paste them into the **stylus** chrome extension to see an instant style preview (recommended).


## Roadmap

 - [ ] Add colorful indention to differentiate different levels (current hacking looks ugly so I temporarily removed it)
 - [ ] Keep on fine-tuning the colors of some non-salient places
 - [ ] Develop a beautiful theme for white mode

## Acknowledgement

I use [logseq](logseq.com) every day and it is really an amazing tool to boost my work. 

This is clone from [Cobra](https://github.com/santiyounger/Cobra).

I know little of CSS so I have to copy much stuff from [dark-hpx](https://github.com/cannibalox/logseq-dark-hpx) and [Cobra](https://github.com/santiyounger/Cobra), and adopt to my favorite color palette. 

Thank you [Anti](https://github.com/santiyounger) and [Cannibalox](https://github.com/cannibalox)!
